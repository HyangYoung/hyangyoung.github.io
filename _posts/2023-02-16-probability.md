## ðŸ¦¥ Introduction to Probability


Essentially probability is the chance of something happening(likelihood of an event occurring).

When dealing with uncertain events, we are seldom satisfied by simply knowing whether an event is likely or unlikely.

$P(x) = \frac{Preferred outcomes}{Sample Space}$

If two events are independent:
The probability of them occurring simultaneously equals the product of them occurring on their own.
$P(A') = P(A) . P(')$

- Trial â€“ Observing an event occur and recording the outcome.
- Experiment â€“ A collection of one or multiple trials.
- Experimental Probability â€“ The probability we assign an event, based on an experiment we conduct.
- Expected value â€“ the specific outcome we expect to occur when we run an experiment.
> Expected value for categorical variables: $E(X) = n X p $

> Expected value for numeric variables:
$E(X) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}{n}{xi X pi}$
