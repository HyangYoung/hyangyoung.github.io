## ü¶• Probability Rule

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (New Probability Rule: The Multiplication Rule &#40;For Independent&#41;)

[//]: # (1. A probability value is a number between 0 &#40;the event will never happen&#41; to 1 &#40;the event is guaranteed to happen&#41;.)

[//]: # (2. The sum of all the probabilities in the sample space must be exactly 1.)

[//]: # (3. The complement of some event A refers to an event in which A does not occur and is equal to 1-P&#40;A&#41;: P&#40;A c &#41; = 1-P&#40;A&#41;)

[//]: # (4. If two events A and B are disjoint, then the probability that event A occurs OR event B occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities. )

[//]: # (5. The probability of some event A occurring AND another event B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (   - P&#40;A and B&#41; = P&#40;A&#41; * P&#40;B&#41;)

[//]: # (   - This rule only applies if the two events are ‚Äúindependent‚Äù.)

[//]: # (   - This rule can be applied to more than two events, e.g., P&#40;A and B and C and D&#41;. However, again, all of the events must be independent.)

1. A probability value is a number between 0 (the event will never happen) to 1 (the event is guaranteed to happen).
2. The sum of all the probabilities in the sample space must be exactly 1.
3. The complement of some event A refers to an event in which A does not occur and is equal to 1-P(A): P(A c ) = 1-P(A)
4. General Addition Rule: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) P(A and B)
5. General Multiplication Rule: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A)
