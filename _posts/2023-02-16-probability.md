## ü¶• Probability Rule

New Probability Rule: The Multiplication Rule (For Independent)
1. A probability value is a number between 0 (the event will never happen) to 1 (the event is guaranteed to happen).
2. The sum of all the probabilities in the sample space must be exactly 1.
3. The complement of some event A refers to an event in which A does not occur and is equal to 1-P(A): P(A c ) = 1-P(A)
4. If two events A and B are disjoint, then the probability that event A occurs OR event B occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities. 
5. The probability of some event A occurring AND another event B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

   - P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
   - This rule only applies if the two events are ‚Äúindependent‚Äù.
   - This rule can be applied to more than two events, e.g., P(A and B and C and D). However, again, all of the events must be independent.
